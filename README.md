# Transportation Management System (TMS)

A full-stack TMS application built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

## 🚀 Features

### Frontend
- **Modern UI** with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Dark/Light theme** toggle
- **Animated hamburger menu** with single-level submenus
- **Horizontal navigation** bar
- **Grid & Tile views** for shipment data
- **Detail modal** with full shipment information
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes

### Backend
- **GraphQL API** with Apollo Server
- **MongoDB** database with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Role-based access control** (admin/employee)
- **Pagination, filtering, and sorting**
- **Performance optimizations** (DataLoader, indexes)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

**Backend:**
Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```
Update `JWT_SECRET` with a secure key.

**Frontend:**
Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local`:
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Update `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` with a secure key (generate using `openssl rand -base64 32`).

### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- **Admin user**: admin@tms.com / admin123
- **Employee user**: employee@tms.com / employee123  
- **50 sample shipments**

  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## **🌱 Seeding Database**

### Run Seed Script

The seed script will:
- Clear existing data
- Create 2 users (admin and employee)
- Create 50 sample shipments with realistic data

```bash
npm run seed
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
🗑️  Cleared existing data
👤 Created users:
   Admin: admin@tms.com / admin123
   Employee: employee@tms.com / employee123
📦 Created 50 shipments

✅ Seeding complete!
```

### Test Users Created

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@tms.com | admin123 |
| Employee | employee@tms.com | employee123 |

---

## **🎮 Testing with GraphQL Playground**

### Open GraphQL Playground

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:4000/graphql**
3. You'll see the GraphQL Playground interface

### Playground Features

- **Left Panel**: Write your queries/mutations
- **Middle Panel**: View results
- **Right Panel**: Documentation explorer (schema docs)
- **Bottom Panel**: Query variables

---

## **🔐 Authentication Testing**

### Step 1: Register a New User (Optional)

```graphql
mutation Register {
  register(input: {
    email: "testuser@tms.com"
    password: "test123"
    name: "Test User"
    role: employee
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
      name
      role
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Login

**Login as Admin:**
```graphql
mutation AdminLogin {
  login(input: {
    email: "admin@tms.com"
    password: "admin123"
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
      name
      role
    }
  }
}
```

**Login as Employee:**
```graphql
mutation EmployeeLogin {
  login(input: {
    email: "employee@tms.com"
    password: "employee123"
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
      name
      role
    }
  }
}
```

**Copy the token from the response!** You'll need it for authenticated requests.

### Step 3: Set Authorization Header

In GraphQL Playground:
1. Click **HTTP Headers** tab at the bottom
2. Add the following:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

Example:
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

    rate: 250.50
    weight: 150.5
    estimatedDelivery: "2025-02-15"
    priority: HIGH
    notes: "Fragile items - handle with care"
  }) {
    id
    trackingNumber
    shipperName
    status
    priority
  }
}
```

### 2. Update a Shipment (Admin Only)

```graphql
mutation UpdateShipment {
  updateShipment(
    id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE"
    input: {
      status: IN_TRANSIT
      priority: URGENT
      notes: "Updated: Priority shipment - expedite delivery"
    }
  ) {
    id
    status
    priority
    notes
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

### 3. Flag/Unflag a Shipment (Admin Only)

**Flag:**
```graphql
mutation FlagShipment {
  flagShipment(id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE", flagged: true) {
    id
    flagged
    trackingNumber
  }
}
```

**Unflag:**
```graphql
mutation UnflagShipment {
  flagShipment(id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE", flagged: false) {
    id
    flagged
    trackingNumber
  }
}
```

### 4. Delete a Shipment (Admin Only)

```graphql
mutation DeleteShipment {
  deleteShipment(id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE")
}
```

---

## **🔒 Authorization Testing**

### Test Admin-Only Features

**Step 1:** Login as Employee and try to delete:

```graphql
mutation TryDeleteAsEmployee {
  deleteShipment(id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE")
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "deleteShipment": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Not authorized: Admin access required",
      "path": ["deleteShipment"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Login as Admin and try the same:

```graphql
mutation DeleteAsAdmin {
  deleteShipment(id: "SHIPMENT_ID_HERE")
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "deleteShipment": true
  }
}
```

### Test Protected Routes

Try accessing a protected mutation WITHOUT authentication:

```graphql
mutation TryCreateWithoutAuth {
  createShipment(input: {
    shipperName: "Test"
    carrierName: "FedEx"
    pickupLocation: {
      address: "123 Main St"
      city: "New York"
      state: "NY"
      zip: "10001"
      country: "USA"
    }
    deliveryLocation: {
      address: "456 Oak Ave"
      city: "Los Angeles"
      state: "CA"
      zip: "90001"
      country: "USA"
    }
    rate: 100
    weight: 50
    estimatedDelivery: "2025-02-15"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "createShipment": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Not authorized: Authentication required",
      "path": ["createShipment"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## **⚡ Performance Testing**

### 1. Test Pagination Performance

Query large datasets:

```graphql
query PerformanceTest {
  shipments(page: 1, limit: 50) {
    shipments {
      id
      trackingNumber
      status
    }
    pagination {
      total
      totalPages
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected:** Response time < 500ms for 50 records

### 2. Test Complex Filters

```graphql
query ComplexFilter {
  shipments(
    filter: {
      status: IN_TRANSIT
      priority: HIGH
      flagged: true
      search: "FedEx"
    }
    sortBy: "rate"
    sortOrder: ASC
    page: 1
    limit: 10
  ) {
    shipments {
      id
      trackingNumber
      rate
      priority
    }
    pagination {
      total
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected:** Response time < 300ms

### 3. Verify Indexes

Check MongoDB indexes are working:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh

# Switch to database
use tms

# View indexes on shipments collection
db.shipments.getIndexes()

# Expected output should show:
# - _id index
# - trackingNumber (unique)
# - status
# - priority
# - carrierName
# - shipperName
# - createdAt
# - Compound indexes
# - Text index
```

### 4. Test Search Performance

```graphql
query SearchPerformance {
  shipments(
    filter: { search: "shipping" }
    limit: 20
  ) {
    shipments {
      id
      shipperName
      carrierName
      trackingNumber
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected:** Full-text search using text index, response < 200ms

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

### MongoDB Connection Issues

**Error:** `MongoServerError: Authentication failed`

**Solution:**
- If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your IP is whitelisted
- Check username/password in connection string

### Port Already in Use

**Error:** `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4000`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 4000
lsof -i :4000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### JWT Token Expired

**Error:** `Not authorized: Invalid token`

**Solution:** Login again to get a fresh token

### Import Errors

**Error:** `Cannot find module '@/...'`

**Solution:** Ensure you're running from the `backend` directory
